An alternative is to either run or build from source.
Helpful if you're on a work computer with tighter application security settings.

Prerequisites:

NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/)
Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com)
Running from source

git clone https://github.com/facebook/flipper.git
cd flipper/desktop
yarn
yarn start
Building from source

yarn build --mac --version $buildNumber
For Building from source, you should do it in the following steps:

git clone https://github.com/facebook/flipper.git
cd flipper/desktop
yarn
yarn build --mac --version $buildNumber
Note: I've noticed building from source as of Aug 2020 0.53.0 has some issues for me, so would recommend running from source if you need to use this.
